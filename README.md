# SKYFALL

A fast, Counter-Strike-inspired bomb-defusal FPS that runs entirely in the browser.
Three.js rendering, procedural textures, synthesized WebAudio, bot AI — no
build step.

**[Play SKYFALL](https://guyzyskind.com/tinystrike/)**

Soldier character models are from the
[Quaternius "Toon Shooter Game Kit"](https://quaternius.com/packs/toonshootergamekit.html)
(CC0), processed headlessly in Blender (mesh pruning, per-loadout weapon
meshes, GLB export) into `assets/models/`. See [ASSETS.md](ASSETS.md) for the
complete asset provenance and licensing record.

Fight across five distinct maps. Play solo with bots, host a humans-only match, or fill online teams with a
mix of humans and bots. Full economy, buy menu, rounds, radar, killfeed, and
bomb objectives are synchronized across the room. Human, bot, and overall
leaderboards reward match wins, eliminations, objectives, and consistency.
First team to 8 round wins takes the match.

## Run

```sh
npm install
npm start
# then open http://localhost:8020
```

The Node server serves the game and hosts WebSocket rooms. A plain static
server still works for solo play, but online rooms require `npm start`.

## Game modes

- **Solo + bots:** the original offline game, with one human CT and bot teams.
- **Humans only:** create a room, share its six-character code, choose CT or T,
  and start after at least one human joins each team.
- **Humans + bots:** create or join a room; each side is filled to five players
  with bots. This mode may also be started by one human.

The room server keeps the canonical roster and state fence while leasing bot
AI, hit resolution, round timers, and objective simulation to one active
client. Other clients send movement and actions to that authority and render
sequenced snapshots. If the authority stalls or disconnects, the server fences
its stale state and transfers the lease to another active player.

## Leaderboards

Rankings are split into Humans, Bots, and Overall season boards. The server
calculates points from completed matches, wins, rounds, eliminations,
headshots, bomb objectives, efficiency, and playtime. Human competition has
the highest value; repeated bot matches taper and have a daily point cap.

Leaderboard data persists atomically in `.tiny-strike/leaderboard.json` by
default. Set `TINY_STRIKE_LEADERBOARD_PATH` and `TINY_STRIKE_SEASON` when
deploying. See [docs/leaderboard-api.md](docs/leaderboard-api.md) for the API,
identity, scoring, and live-room protocol.

### Career progression and returning players

Every player has a permanent server-side career with lifetime XP, levels,
tiers, personal records, streaks, per-map and per-mode totals, and achievements.
The menu surfaces current rank, the next level, a daily bot contract, nearby
rivals, and a direct leaderboard link. Bot leaderboard points taper after
repeated daily matches for competitive fairness, while every completed bot
match still earns at least 30 career XP and the daily contract awards bonus XP.

The browser automatically resumes a career using an opaque private progress
key stored locally; the server stores only its SHA-256 digest. Offline or
temporarily failed solo results are queued with their owning career and retried
after the identity is validated. To move devices or survive cleared browser
storage, copy the private progress key from **Profile → Play on another
device**, keep it secret, and restore it on the other device. There is no
password/account recovery service: possession of that key is possession of the
career.

Solo results are plausibility-checked and idempotent, but the browser remains
the source of solo gameplay telemetry. The public bot board is therefore an
engagement leaderboard, not a cheat-proof competitive authority. Human-room
results are accepted only from the room service.

Append `?test` to the URL for the automated-test mode (auto-starts the match
and simulates pointer lock for synthetic input).

## Controls

Keyboard controls can be remapped from **Settings** on the main menu. Settings
also provides live look-sensitivity (`0.25×–3.00×`) and brightness
(`−0.50–+0.50 EV`) controls; preferences are saved on this device.

Kevlar and defuse kits in the Gear tab of the buy menu.

## Architecture

See [SPEC.md](SPEC.md) for the original gameplay architecture. The gameplay
modules (world, player, weapons, viewmodel, combat, bots, rounds, HUD, audio,
effects, input) communicate over a synchronous event bus and are wired in
[src/main.js](src/main.js). [src/network/multiplayer.js](src/network/multiplayer.js)
adds room UI, remote human entities, interpolation, client input forwarding,
and host snapshots. [server.mjs](server.mjs) owns rooms, teams, host selection,
and WebSocket message routing.

## Tests

```sh
npm test
```

The protocol test opens two real WebSocket clients and verifies room creation,
balanced teams, match start, state replication, and shot forwarding.

## Render deployment

This repository is ready to deploy as a single Node web service on Render.
`render.yaml` uses `npm ci`, starts `npm start`, and checks `/health`.

1. Push this folder to your GitHub repository.
2. In Render choose **New → Blueprint** and select the repository.
3. Render reads `render.yaml` and deploys the `skyfall` service.
4. Open the generated `onrender.com` address. Multiplayer uses the same origin automatically (`/ws`).

/**
 * Half-resolution, depth-only screen-space ambient occlusion.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *
 * Before this pass the only occlusion in the level was per-texel: `owORM.r`
 * (the baked cavity map) and the dressing's vertex masks. Both are tile-scale,
 * so nothing darkened where a wall met the sand, inside a window reveal, under
 * an awning or between two stacked crates — every object in the frame met the
 * ground on a razor line. That is the single most repeated note from the
 * reference comparison.
 *
 * WHERE IT IS APPLIED, AND WHY THAT MATTERS
 *
 * The term is multiplied into `reflectedLight.indirectDiffuse` inside the
 * material shader (src/gfx/materials/shader.js, the `aomap_fragment` override),
 * NOT over the composited image. Ambient occlusion is a visibility factor on
 * the *ambient* integral; multiplying the final frame by it would darken direct
 * sunlight, which no amount of occlusion geometry can do — a crate foot in full
 * sun has a sharp cast shadow, not a soft grey smudge. The injection point in
 * shader.js already existed and was already indirect-only, which is the
 * physically right place, so this pass only has to deliver a screen-space
 * visibility term to it.
 *
 * The GLSL that consumes it lives HERE (`SSAO_PARS_FRAGMENT` / `SSAO_APPLY`)
 * rather than in shader.js so the whole estimator — the buffer layout, the
 * depth guard and the calibration constants — stays in one file with the pass
 * that produces it. shader.js only has to interpolate two strings and merge one
 * uniform block; see scratchpad/ssao-shader-patch.md.
 *
 * ORDER OF OPERATIONS
 *
 *   depth prepass (half res, MeshDepthMaterial override)   ~0.30 ms
 *     -> AO estimate  (half res, 10 taps)                  ~0.20 ms
 *     -> bilateral blur H then V (half res, 5 taps each)    ~0.10 ms
 *     -> beauty pass reads it by gl_FragCoord
 *
 * The prepass runs BEFORE the beauty pass, which is what lets the material
 * shader read a same-frame AO buffer. The alternative — reusing the beauty
 * pass's own depth and applying the result one frame later — is cheaper by a
 * whole geometry submit but needs reprojection to survive a fast turn, and a
 * 500 deg/s flick at 60 fps moves a pixel 178 px at this FOV. Measured, the
 * prepass costs 0.30 ms on the heaviest map, which is worth paying to keep the
 * term registered to the frame it belongs to.

 * THE DEPTH GUARD
 *
 * A half-res buffer sampled bilinearly at full res leaks across silhouettes,
 * and the first-person weapon — 0.2 to 0.6 m from the eye and the largest thing
 * on screen — would otherwise be shaded with occlusion computed from the wall
 * eight metres behind it. So the AO buffer carries its own depth in .g and the
 * term is faded out where that depth disagrees with the fragment's.
 *
 * The depth is stored as log2 over the near..far range rather than linearly:
 * 8 bits over log2(400 / 0.05) = 12.97 octaves is 3.6% relative depth per code
 * value at every distance, where a linear 8-bit encoding would quantise to
 * 1.6 m and be useless for anything closer than the far plane. Log depth also
 * interpolates sanely — a bilinear blend of two log depths is their geometric
 * mean — which matters because this texture is filtered.
 *
 * The 0.02..0.06 rejection window is 20%..71% relative depth (2^(d/k), k =
 * 1/12.97). That is deliberately loose: it has to accept a floor seen at a
 * grazing angle, where two adjacent half-res texels legitimately differ by
 * several per cent, while still rejecting the weapon against the world (26x,
 * fully rejected) and a foreground prop against a distant wall.

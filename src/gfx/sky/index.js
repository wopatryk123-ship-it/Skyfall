 * photometric chain in atmosphere.js predicts a sunlit stucco wall at ~0.32
 * radiance units while a facade in the old 16:30 frame came back at 0.144 —
 * 1.1 stops under. The material forge has replaced those surfaces since.

 * RE-MEASURED against the shipped materials, by rendering each map material on
 * a unit quad under a single white directional light of irradiance pi at normal
 * incidence, so the readback IS the albedo the shader produces (bake x tint x
 * the runtime macro, dust and grime layers). A white lambertian reference

 * 1.1. At 1.55 the same wall came out at 0.409, which is 0.35 stops OVER the
 * model: the gain had gone from under-paying a deficit to over-paying one.
 *
 * So: 1.0. What is left is 0.28 stops of albedo, it is 0.28 stops in the BAKE
 * (a lime plaster is 0.35-0.50 reflectance and this one is 0.25), and it
 * belongs to src/gfx/materials — not here. Paying it here is not even neutral:
 * `map.js` keys its global interior-floor AmbientLight off `sunLight.intensity`,
 * so every stop added to the key was also added to the largest single fill term
 * in the frame, and the key:fill ratio the gain was supposed to protect barely

/**
 * HOW THE ONE SHADOW MAP IS SPENT — and why it is no longer spent on a sphere
 * following the player.
 *
 * There is one directional shadow map and a 104 x 84 m arena to put it on, and
 * exactly three ways to spend it. This file has now shipped two of them, so the
 * trade is written down instead of re-argued:
 *
 *  1. A SQUARE BOX FOLLOWING THE CAMERA — what this replaced. 3072^2 over a
 *     ±40 m box is 2.60 cm/texel, the best texel of the three, and it is still
 *     the wrong answer, because a receiver OUTSIDE the ortho does not get "no
 *     shadow map here" from three, it gets `shadow = 1.0`: full sun. What the
 *     box covers on the ground is an ellipse — 40 m across the beam, 40/sin(alt)
 *     = 98 m along it at 24 degrees — so the shortfall is entirely in the two
 *     corners on the across-beam axis. MEASURED, per cent of each arena's own
 *     footprint inside that box, on a 1 m grid at ground height, over nine
 *     camera placements (centre, both long axes, four corners):
 *
 *       harbor    79.1 - 83.8      frostline 78.6 - 85.4
 *       citadel   84.0 - 87.4      dustyard  91.2 - 94.3
 *       neon      98.9 - 100
 *
 *     i.e. up to 21 per cent of Harbor renders with no cast shadow in it at all,
 *     and it is at the corners, which is where the defuses happen. Top-down on
 *     Citadel the perimeter wall's own shadow band stops dead short of the
 *     north-west corner and the south-east tower casts nothing at all.
 *     (Neon is nearly covered by luck: its moon sits due west, so its
 *     across-beam axis is the map's 76 m short axis, which fits in ±40.)
 *
 *  2. A STATIC BOX FITTED TO THE ARENA — what this is now. The box is the
 *     scene's own caster/receiver AABB, projected onto the light's axes, so it
 *     is a RECTANGLE, not a square: the across-beam extent is the arena's
 *     diagonal but the up-beam extent is that diagonal compressed by sin(alt)
 *     plus the wall height by cos(alt). MEASURED per map (3072^2, ground texel,
 *     across the beam / along it, and the fraction of the footprint covered):
 *
 *       map        was                 now                     covered
 *       dustyard   2.60 / 6.42 cm      3.53 / 4.98 cm          91-94% -> 100%
 *       citadel    2.60 / 6.40         4.42 / 5.55             84-87% -> 100%
 *       harbor     2.60 / 6.41         4.58 / 5.29             79-84% -> 100%
 *       frostline  2.60 / 7.30         4.23 / 4.86             79-85% -> 100%
 *       neon       2.60 / 5.06         2.74 / 4.38             99-100% -> 100%
 *
 *     "Covered" is the fraction of the arena's own footprint inside the ortho, on
 *     a 1 m grid at ground height, and the 100 is 100 from all nine camera
 *     placements on all five maps, because the box no longer depends on the
 *     camera at all.
 *
 *     Across the beam it is up to 1.76x coarser; ALONG the beam it is finer on
 *     every map, because that is the axis the old square box was wasting. A 2 m
 *     crate's shadow is 44 x 38 texels instead of 77 x 31 — the smallest
 *     dimension it has anywhere went UP. Cost: every caster is now inside the
 *     frustum every frame, so none are culled out of the depth pass. MEASURED
 *     with `post.profile(60)` on Citadel, three interleaved A/B pairs at
 *     2560x1440: chain 13.59 / 14.71 / 13.74 ms fitted against 13.37 / 13.85 /
 *     13.26 square, i.e. about +0.3 ms on 13.4 — a third of the ±1.1 ms spread
 *     between repeats of the same configuration.
 *
 *     What it fixes, measured from the player's eye rather than from above:
 *     standing in Citadel's north-west corner looking in, the shadow term
 *     covered 32.75 % of the frame and now covers 51.01 % — 18.28 % of every
 *     pixel on screen went from "full sun" to "in shadow", and 0.02 % went the
 *     other way. The south-east corner is the same figure (21.06 -> 39.35 %,
 *     +18.35 / -0.04). That corner is a roofed timber deck, and what it looked
 *     like before is the review finding this rewrite answers: the roof directly
 *     overhead cast nothing, so the boards under it rendered in full afternoon
 *     sun. From the map centre the same comparison is +0.98 / -0.21 %, which is
 *     why this was easy to miss — the hole is only large when you are in it.
 *
 *  3. CASCADES. Two or more boxes need per-fragment cascade selection in the lit
 *     material's shader, which lives in `gfx/materials/shader.js`, and would buy
 *     a texel this arena size does not need: at 4.5 cm the limit on shadow
 *     detail here is the PCF kernel, not the grid.
 *
 * The static box also throws away two problems the moving one had: nothing
 * crawls (the box is nailed to world space, so no texel snapping is needed at
 * all), and shadow quality no longer depends on where the player happens to be
 * standing.

 * Depth bias and normal offset, in shadow texels.

 * leaves both offsets where they were measured when the fit changed shape —
 * the fitted rectangle trades across-beam precision for up-beam precision, so
 * its mean texel is 2.46-3.13 cm against the square box's flat 2.604.
 *
 * Both were absolute before that: `bias = -0.0004` over a near/far of 200..1000,
 * i.e. an 800 m depth range, which is 32 cm of depth pushed into every receiver.
 * With the sun at 21 degrees that detaches a shadow from its caster by
 * 32/tan(21) = 83 cm — a crate's shadow started a crate's width away from the
 * crate. Tying both to the texel instead means the frustum can be refitted
 * without retuning anything: 0.15 texels of depth on a 2.604 cm texel is 3.9 mm.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHY THE DEPTH BIAS IS 0.15 AND THE NORMAL OFFSET IS 1.3
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Both offsets push the shadow along the light's axis, so on a floor they slide
 * the shadow away from its caster by `(depth + normal) / tan(altitude)`. At
 * 0.9 + 1.6 texels on a 2.604 cm texel that is 6.51 cm, and at Dustyard's
 * 23.94-degree sun **14.7 cm** of detachment — a bright band of sand between a
 * barrel and its own shadow, which is the "nothing in this map is grounded" the
 * critics led with. At Frostline's 20.91 degrees it was 17.0 cm.
 *
 * The two offsets do NOT buy the same thing, and that is the whole point:
 *
 *   - the NORMAL offset is slope-aware. It moves the sample point along the
 *     receiver's own normal, so it grows exactly where the depth gradient across
 *     a texel grows, and it is what actually suppresses acne.
 *   - the DEPTH bias is a flat constant in normalised depth. It cannot know the
 *     slope, so it has to be sized for the worst receiver in the scene, and
 *     everywhere else it is pure peter-panning tax.
 *
 * The instrument, unchanged from when 0.15 was chosen: render the frame twice,
 * once with the key light casting and once with `castShadow = false`, and divide
 * — that is the shadow term per pixel with no material or exposure term in it.
 * "Spurious" is a shadowed pixel more than 10 px from anything already shadowed
 * at a deliberately over-biased 3.0/1.8 reference, i.e. one that cannot belong to
 * a real terminator. MEASURED on the 20 m top-down (the eye-level view reads 0.000
 * for every row below, on every map — nothing there is acne-prone), with the
 * fitted box above:
 *
 *   normal   frostline            harbor               citadel
 *            gap      spurious    gap      spurious    gap      spurious
 *   1.6      12.42 cm  0.016 %    12.35 cm  0.005 %    12.42 cm  0.312 %
 *   1.3      10.29     0.022      10.23     0.006      10.29     0.366
 *   1.1        8.87    0.177        8.82    0.068        8.87    0.384
 *   0.9        7.45    0.500        7.41    0.672         —        —
 *
 * The knee is at 1.1: one row below it the spurious rate goes up an order of
 * magnitude on both of the acne-prone maps (Frostline is flat 0.75-albedo snow
 * with drift relief in it; Harbor is a flat wet quay). 1.3 sits one row above the
 * knee at 1.4x the speckle of 1.6, and buys back everything the bigger box cost.
 * Contact gap, MEASURED before -> after, i.e. ±40 m square at 1.6 texels ->
 * fitted box at 1.3:
 *
 *   dustyard 10.27 -> 8.73 cm    citadel 10.23 -> 10.29    harbor 10.26 -> 10.23
 *   frostline 11.93 -> 10.29     neon      7.58 ->  6.00
 *
 * So the whole arena gets a cast shadow AND nothing in the game peter-pans worse
 * than it did — three maps improve, two are inside 0.06 cm. (Citadel's spurious
 * rate is 0.31-0.38 % at every row, barely moving with the offset: that map is
 * stepped stone and most of what the metric counts there is real terminator too
 * fine for the reference to have dilated over, not acne.)
 *
 * The residual ~8 cm is the normal offset alone (3.5 cm / tan 24). Buying it back
 * means a smaller texel — a 4096 map is 134 MB with its depth buffer against 76 —
 * and it is not worth 3 cm; a contact-shadow or AO pass is, and the AO pass now
 * exists (`gfx/post/ssao.js`).

 * Sky, atmosphere and global lighting.
 *
 * Ported from the OVERWATCH engine and adapted to Tiny Strike: the atmosphere,
 * LUTs, dome, clouds and starfield are unchanged; the raymarched volumetrics
 * are not ported (we keep three.Fog, coloured from this sky by `applyFogTo`),
 * and the class is constructed directly with a renderer/scene/camera instead of

 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHAT THIS OWNS
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   - A Hillaire/Bruneton atmosphere (Rayleigh + Mie + ozone + multiple
 *     scattering) evaluated through three LUTs, drawn as a full-screen dome
 *     with a limb-darkened solar disc and an analytic circumsolar aureole that
 *     restores the Mie forward peak the LUT resolution destroys.
 *                                                               dome.js luts.js
 *   - Sun and moon positions from real spherical astronomy.       celestial.js
 *   - A starfield with a magnitude power law, blackbody colours, airmass
 *     extinction, scintillation, and a Milky Way with dust lanes.     stars.js
 *   - Two procedural cloud decks, self-shadowed and correctly lit.   clouds.js
 *   - A PMREM environment map regenerated from the sky whenever the sun moves
 *     meaningfully, published as `scene.environment` — the image-based light
 *     that replaced the maps' hemisphere+ambient pair.
 *   - The sun/moon `DirectionalLight`s, one of which casts the single shadow
 *     map — fitted to the whole arena as a rectangle in the light's own axes, so
 *     no part of any map is silently shadowless.       _fitShadow _measureArena

/**
 * The bolt-action sniper rifle — an Accuracy International AW pattern.
 *
 * A bolt gun is not a carbine with a scope on it. What makes it read:
 *
 *   - a CYLINDRICAL receiver with a big open ejection port and a barrel that
 *     is heavy all the way to the crown, not stepped down behind a gas block;
 *   - no gas system at all — the space above the barrel is empty, which is
 *     exactly what makes the profile so clean;
 *   - the bolt: a body running in the receiver, a handle bent down and back on
 *     the right with a spherical knob, and a shrouded rear;
 *   - a full chassis stock with a thumbhole, an adjustable cheek riser SITTING
 *     ON the comb and a rubber butt pad — one continuous line from the pistol
 *     grip to the toe;
 *   - a 34 mm scope in two RINGS with exposed capped turrets and a sunshade,
 *     standing 70 mm over the bore, which is what the cheek riser exists for;
 *   - six flutes cut into the barrel, and a 10-round straight box magazine.
 *
 * REAL DIMENSIONS this is built to (AI AW / AWM):
 *   overall length     1180 mm      modelled 1146
 *   barrel              610 mm      modelled 602
 *   scope over bore   60-75 mm      modelled 70   (was 112 — ultra-high rings
 *                                                  with the cheek 46 mm short
 *                                                  of the comb underneath)
 *   scope tube           34 mm, 50 mm objective
 *   .338 Lapua Magnum   case 69.2 mm, OAL 93.5 mm, rim 14.9 mm
 *   magazine, 10 rd     108 x 27 x 96.5 mm

  // ---- chassis stock -------------------------------------------------------
  /**
   * One continuous aluminium chassis: forend under the barrel, thumbhole
   * through the wrist, comb and toe out to the butt. Authored as a side
   * outline in (z, y) and extruded across the weapon's width, with the
   * thumbhole as a real hole in the shape.
   *
   * The COMB was raised 36 mm behind the thumbhole. With the scope dropped to
   * 70 mm over the bore the shooter's eye is at y = 0.148, so the cheek has to
   * be within ~38 mm of that; the old top line sat at bore-0.030 and left the
   * riser and its two posts hanging in mid-air 46 mm above the wood.
   *
   * THE OUTLINE IS NOW TWO MONOTONE CHAINS, and that is the whole point of the
   * rewrite. The previous one listed a belly line running rearward and a second
   * line running forward that CROSSED it — measured, edges 2->3 and 14->15
   * intersected at (z = 0.3, y = 4.4) mm, which is the web of the shooting hand.
   * A self-intersecting contour is a figure eight, and Earcut has no defined
   * answer for one: MEASURED on the built mesh, the chassis came out with 12
   * boundary edges (i.e. NOT watertight — you could see into it), it pinched to
   * a 7 mm waist at z = 0, and the region under the receiver from y = 31 to the
   * receiver's own underside at 57.2 was EMPTY over 190 mm of the rifle's
   * length. So the action floated over a void, the pistol grip hung off nothing,
   * and the shooting hand sat in that void — which is exactly the complaint
   * ("the hand is not on the grip but in the shaft/chamber", "the model has
   * holes in it"). Three of the six thumbhole vertices were also OUTSIDE the
   * contour, so the hole was cut half in mid-air and only its rear third
   * survived, 60 mm behind where a thumb goes.
   *
   * Now: the bottom chain runs front to back with z strictly increasing, the top
   * chain runs back to front with z strictly decreasing, and the top is above
   * the bottom at every z — which makes self-intersection impossible by
   * construction rather than by inspection.
   *
   * The numbers the two chains have to hit:
   *   - top face at bore - 0.023 under the action. `extrude`'s 2.2 mm bevel
   *     grows the outline outward, so that lands the built face at 57.2 mm =
   *     bore - rRec, the receiver's own underside. The action is bedded, not
   *     floating, and the recoil lug (y 41.2..61.2) is let into it by 16 mm.
   *   - the notch at z = 0.145 is the bolt relief and it CANNOT be filled: the
   *     shroud sweeps back to y 63.5..92.5 at z = 160..184 on every cycle (see
   *     the cheek-riser note below), so the wrist has to duck under it.
   *   - the belly behind the grip sits at bore - 0.092..0.096, i.e. 8-16 mm
   *     higher than the old toe line. A thumbhole stock is a thin plank there —
   *     the grip's toe hangs well below the stock's underside — and it is also
   *     what stops the heel of the shooting hand being inside the wood.

// ============================================================================
// TINY STRIKE — set dressing.
//
// The maps are authored as axis-aligned boxes (spec rule 7) because that is
// what the collision, the nav graph and the bot tactics are validated against.
// This pass reads those boxes back and builds everything a box cannot express —
// copings, plinths, pilasters, windows, doorways, shopfronts, balconies,
// drainpipes, roof plant, market stalls, laundry, kerbs, drifts, rubble,
// cables and signage. Substantial free-standing props also register an
// invisible deterministic AABB in the world's solid layer; trim, cloth,
// vegetation and sub-step clutter remain visual-only.
//
// The solid proxies are queued until every read-back pass is complete, then
// appended to `world.solids` and `world.colliders` in lockstep before the world
// batches its solids. Everything visible is still merged into one mesh per
// material, so a fully dressed arena costs ~20 extra draw calls.
//
// It is also fully deterministic: seeded off the map id, no Math.random, so two
// players in the same room see the same street. Each pass draws from its own
// forked stream, so editing one pass does not re-roll the whole level.
//
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE GROUNDING CONTRACT — read this before adding anything
//
// Every defect this file has ever shipped has been a prop that did not touch
// what it was standing on or bolted to. Three rules, all enforced by helpers
// rather than by numbers typed at the call site:
//
//  1. Anything on the ground goes through `groundProp()`, which finds the
//     surface with `standing()` and seats the prop on its OWN measured base
//     plane (`buildProp().baseY`). No call site ever names a height.
//  2. Anything on a wall goes through `wallProp()`, which puts the prop's own
//     seat plane (`buildProp().seatZ`) exactly on the wall face, and only after
//     `backedByWall()` proves there is masonry behind it across its whole width
//     — a face being "exposed" says nothing about whether an archway, a door
//     opening or a setback has left daylight where the bracket would go.
//  3. Anything stacked goes on the measured top of what is under it
//     (`buildProp().top`), never on a nominal size.
//  4. Anything bolted to a wall reserves the patch of render it covers
//     (`claimWall`) and checks it first (`wallFree`), exactly as ground props
//     reserve a footprint disc. Without it two passes that each ask "is there
//     wall behind me?" both answer yes and an awning ends up through a
//     signboard — which is what the Citadel review found in four bays.
//  5. Anything the weather is the reason for — an awning, a canopy, a market
//     stall — needs sky above it (`openSky`). A market awning inside a roofed
//     customs hall was the loudest "procedural" tell on Harbor.

 *                      on the map's only central landmark
 *   citadel A/B pads   27 x 15 m paving centred at y 1.25 (underside 1.22) on a

 * cornice or roof cap authored to fly (Frostline's 12.4 x 36.4 m roof plates

   * wall-mounted air conditioners and a satellite dish, modern street lamp
   * posts, palm trees, plastic bins, and tyre stacks whose `decor:rubber` mesh

   * ASKED what the map is. Everything below is that question, answered once.
   *
   * What replaces it: banners, braziers, iron sconces, timber hoardings,
   * barrels, sacks and cloth market stalls — and the cloth is the map's own

   * rather than as the teal awnings the review counted.

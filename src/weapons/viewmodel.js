// TINY STRIKE — src/weapons/viewmodel.js (module E)
//
// First-person weapon viewmodels: eleven authored weapon GLBs plus one
// canonical skinned arm taken from the CT NPC. Primitive weapons remain only
// as synchronous loading/error fallbacks; rejected procedural hands are not
// used. Persistent wrappers copy the camera transform every frame (no second
// camera / layer tricks), and 'weapon:equip' toggles their visibility.
//
// Public API (per spec):
//   getMuzzleWorldPos(outVec3) -> world position of the current muzzle tip
//                                 (fallback: camera forward 0.4 m)
//   getWeaponGroup()           -> current visible weapon group (or null)
//   update(dt)                 -> copy camera transform, then apply animation
//
// Procedural animations:
//   - idle sway with mouse-look lag + breathing
//   - run/walk bob synced to game.player.moveSpeed2D
//   - fire kick (on 'weapon:fire' byPlayer), pistol slide cycling, AWP bolt
//   - reload drop/tilt/mag-swap choreography timed to the event's duration
//   - equip raise from below, knife slash arcs, grenade wind-up + throw
//   - landing dip ('player:land'), airborne float
//   - model hidden entirely while game.weapons.isScoped()
//
// Scene-graph layout:
//   rig (copies camera pos+quat)  -> added to game.scene
//     pivot (at PIVOT, camera space; all animation offsets applied here so
//            rotations pivot near the grip, not the camera origin)
//       one group per weapon id (posed lower-right, visible one at a time)
//
// No allocations in per-frame code; event handlers only set flags/timers.

/**
 * Size of the operative's hand — ONE number, in weapon space, for all eleven.
 *
 * npc-arms-ct.glb is the CT soldier's own right arm, exported at the source
 * file's scale. MEASURED in VM_Grip space: the finger-weighted skin spans
 * 288 x 320 x 330 mm, the Index2R-to-Pinky2R knuckle row spans 173.1 mm and the
 * forearm runs back to z = +596 mm. The character itself is scaled
 * 1.83 / 2.2699 = 0.806 in game (src/ai/bots.js), so the hand a bot carries a
 * weapon with is ~232 mm across — these are stylised soldiers with deliberately
 * oversized hands, which reads fine at third-person distance and reads as a
 * catcher's mitt swallowing the gun when it is 380 mm from the eye. Shot at
 * 0.806: the fist covered the whole receiver and the magazine.
 *
 * 0.33 puts the fist at 95 x 106 x 109 mm, which is a gloved human hand (male
 * 50th-percentile breadth across the metacarpals is 89 mm, ~95 mm gloved), and
 * its grip aperture then matches the 30-35 mm pistol grips these weapons
 * actually have. Below ~0.30 the hand stops reading as a hand and the forearm
 * is too short to reach the corner of the frame; above ~0.42 the fingers are
 * thicker than the grip they are wrapped around.
 *
 * WHAT THIS NUMBER IS MEASURED AGAINST, and the bug that produced two
 * complaints of "the hand is much too big and out of proportion with the gun":
 *
 * the arm and the weapon are children of the SAME wrapper (`_applyProcedural`
 * adds the weapon, `_attachNPCArms` adds the arm), and the geometry inside that
 * wrapper is life size — the procedural AK really is 900 mm long there. The
 * wrapper's own scale is the viewmodel-FOV stand-in (0.80 to 1.0, see
 * PROC_POSES note 4). So the hand-to-gun ratio is set ENTIRELY by the arm's
 * local scale, and the wrapper shrinks hand and gun together.
 *
 * This slot previously stored, per family, this number DIVIDED BY that family's
 * wrapper scale, so that the hand would be the same size in CAMERA space on
 * every weapon. MEASURED consequence, in weapon space where the guns are life
 * size: the same fist was 101 mm across on a pistol, 106 on the MP5, 110 on the
 * rifles and 117 on the AWP — a 25% spread, and 8-30% larger than a human hand
 * on the weapon it was gripping. Constant in camera space is exactly the same
 * statement as "not in proportion to the gun", because the gun is not constant
 * in camera space; and it was worst on the AWP and the MP5, which are the two
 * that were reported. Both extremes have now been shot: 0.806 (the character's
 * own) swallows the receiver, and dividing by the wrapper looms in the lower
 * half of the frame.
 *
 * So every family carries this scale UNDIVIDED. The hand is then in proportion
 * to its weapon by construction on all eleven, and it is the knife and the
 * grenades — the wrapper-scale-1.0 pair that no one ever complained about, and
 * therefore the reference — whose proportion the other nine now inherit.
 *
 * 0.221, NOT the anatomical 0.33. The 0.33 derivation (95 mm gloved
 * metacarpals / 288 mm authored skin) is sound as anatomy and was still
 * rejected on sight by the user after playing with it: "the hands are still
 * way too big, reduce them by 33%". A stylised low-poly hand at true scale
 * reads bigger than a real hand — it has no finger separation, so the
 * silhouette is one solid mitt of the full envelope. 0.33 * 0.67 = 0.221.
 * Every pos below is re-solved at this scale (pos = grip - R*S*FIST_CENTER),
 * and the rifle/smg presentation offset is scaled by the same 0.67 so the
 * smaller fist sits ON the handle instead of inheriting a hiding offset
 * sized for a bigger one.

// Poses for the procedurally modelled firearms (src/gfx/weapons).
//
// These are NOT the GLB poses. The authored GLBs put their origin at the grip
// with the bore only a few millimetres above it; the procedural models are
// dimensionally real, so the origin is the web of the shooting hand and the
// bore sits 75 mm above it on a rifle, 36 mm on a pistol. Reusing the GLB
// numbers therefore dropped the whole weapon a bore-height too low and, at
// 0.48 m from a 74-degree eye, filled a third of the frame with receiver.
//
// Solved from the bore rather than from where the receiver happens to land:
//   1. the bore axis converges on the crosshair — a few degrees left and a
//      touch nose-down, so the muzzle projects up-left of the receiver, on its
//      way to the centre of the screen. That is what reads as "pointing where
//      I am aiming"; a bore parallel to the view direction does not.
//   2. rolled 1-3 degrees so the left flank of the receiver — the side the
//      magwell, the selector and the rollmark are on — turns toward the camera.
//   3. pushed out to 0.29-0.42 m so the whole weapon is inside the frame with
//      the muzzle visible. Anything closer and the barrel leaves the top-left.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//   4. `scale` is the viewmodel-FOV stand-in. A real 880 mm AK held 375 mm from
//      a 74-degree eye is enormous — correct, and unusable: every shooter draws
//      its viewmodel with a narrower field of view than the world (typically
//      55-65 degrees against 74-90) so the weapon reads at arm's length instead
//      of pressed against the lens. We render the viewmodel in the world scene
//      with the world camera, so the same effect is bought by scaling the whole
//      wrapper — weapon AND hands together, so the grip never drifts.

  //     now looks down onto the slide's top flat.
  //   - the sleeve's cut ring projects at NDC y = -1.09 (deagle) to -1.15
  //     (glock) at rest and stays below -1.0 with a +12 mm bob-peak lift, so
  //     the sleeve exits through the bottom row (139 px of it on the usp)

// First-person arm: the operative's own.
//
// This slot briefly held a procedurally modelled PAIR of arms — jointed
// fingers, gloves, a contact solve against the handguard — on the reasoning
// that the authored arm is only 696 triangles with no fingers and leaves the
// rifles held one-handed. That was the wrong trade and it was rejected on
// sight: a hand modelled from scratch sitting beside the authored soldier
// reads as another game's asset, and two of them wrapped around the gun made
// the mismatch louder. Fidelity of the hand is worth less than belonging to
// the same character the player sees everywhere else in the game.
//
// So all twelve weapons now do what the knife and the grenades always did:
// ONE arm, cloned from npc-arms-ct.glb, tinted from the player profile
// palette so the sleeve and skin match the operative they picked, and posed
// per weapon family by NPC_ARM_POSES.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

// The arm GLB is authored in meters with VM_Grip at its identity origin, and
// `pos` / `rot` / `scale` are family-level tuning controls in wrapper space.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// HOW THESE THREE NUMBERS WERE SOLVED (they are not eyeballed offsets)
//
// 1. rot.x = -(grip rake). Every one of these weapons has a raked pistol grip
//    (addPistolGrip `angle`: 0.28 rad on the Deagle to 0.38 on the M4). The
//    fist's grip channel runs along the arm's own +Y — MEASURED from the bone
//    row, index knuckle at y = +39 mm down to pinky at y = -130 mm with only
//    10 mm of z between them — so tipping the arm back by the rake lays that
//    channel on the grip's axis instead of on the vertical. -0.300 rad is the
//    middle of the family spread and was shot on all seven firearms.
//
// 2. rot.y = +0.524 rad (30 deg). Without it the fingers, which run 180 mm
//    straight down -Z from the wrist before curling 40 mm to -X, closed 18 mm
//    PAST the front strap and the hand read as a fist parked beside the gun:
//    the authored pose is clenched around the character pack's AK, whose grip
//    is 152 mm thick against our 30. Yawing the hand inboard shortens the
//    forward reach to 50 mm, brings the fingertips around onto the far side of
//    the strap where the camera can see them, and swings the forearm out to the
//    lower-right corner where an FPS arm belongs. Shot at 0 / 22 / 35 deg; 30
//    is where the wrap closes without the wrist twisting.
//
// 3. pos = grip - R * S * NPC_ARM_FIST_CENTER, i.e. whatever offset lands the
//    middle of the fist on the grip axis after the rotation and scale above.
//    `grip` is the point 42% of the way down the pistol grip from its top,
//    computed from that weapon's own addPistolGrip(y, z, angle, len) — the
//    fraction is where a hand actually rides a grip, high enough that the web
//    is under the tang and low enough that the pinky is not off the bottom:
//      rifle  ak47 (0, -5.7, 15.0) / m4a1 (0, -2.8, 30.1) -> mean used
//      smg    mp5  (0, -7.6, 21.9)
//      sniper awp  (0, -7.3, 23.5)
//      pistol usp/glock (0, -18.7, 29.5) / deagle (0, -25.1, 31.3) -> mean
//    Two weapons share each firearm family and their grips differ by up to
//    15 mm in z, so the family value is their mean and each is at most 7.5 mm
//    off its own grip — under 1% of frame width at the viewmodel's distance.
//
// 4. scale = NPC_ARM_SCALE on every family, undivided. The derivation and the
//    two ways of getting it wrong are written out on that constant; the short
//    version is that the wrapper is shared with the weapon, so a scale that is
//    constant HERE is a hand that is in proportion to the gun, and a scale that
//    is constant in camera space is not. Changing it means re-solving `pos`.
//
// The knife and the grenades have no pistol grip. Their GLBs are authored with
// the origin AT the grip point, so their target is grip = (12, 18, 0) mm off it
// — the fist centre rides ABOVE the handle line, which is where it sits in a
// hammer grip (the handle beds against the base of the fingers, it is not
// swallowed by the middle of the fist) and which is also what keeps the wrist
// inside the frame: these two wrappers sit at z = -0.35, the closest of the
// eleven, and centred on the origin the bottom 28 mm of the fist and the whole
// sleeve fell out of the bottom of the screen, leaving a floating fist.
// Their rot is +0.244 rad of pitch and +0.384 of yaw for the same reason as the
// firearms — shot against -0.96 and -1.57 rad of pitch, which stood the sleeve
// cone up across the middle of the screen.
//
// The `fallback` offset temporarily seats the same arm against the synchronous
// primitive weapon while the real model builds; it is removed once the real
// model (procedural or GLB) replaces that fallback. The primitive grips were
// modelled 27-39 mm below and up to 51 mm behind the real ones, so these are
// the previously tuned primitive offsets minus the `grip` target above.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Every family carries NPC_ARM_SCALE itself — see the note on that constant for
// why it is no longer divided by the wrapper scale. `pos` is re-solved with it:
// pos = grip - R * NPC_ARM_SCALE * NPC_ARM_FIST_CENTER, and because `grip` and
// `rot` are untouched the fist centre lands on the SAME wrapper-space point it
// did before (verified live on all nine visible weapons: 0.000 mm of drift).
//
// The solved seat was NOT abandoned by the presentation fix below — but the
// rifle and SMG families now carry a deliberate (+5, -8, 0) mm offset on top
// of it. That is the player's own verdict, not a solver output: the hand's job
// in first person is to exist peripherally, and after the finger curl was
// relaxed (see NPC_ARM_GRIP) the long guns still showed the sleeve's cut end
// hanging 5 px inside the bottom frame edge on the M4. Half a centimetre right
// and eight millimetres down keeps every finger ON the grip (the fist centre
// stays 5 mm off the bore line and 87/78 mm under the bore — inside the same
// tolerances the solve used) while the sleeve now leaves through the bottom of
// the frame. MEASURED from the eye (?arm=1&eye=1, FOV 74, 2560x1440): the m4a1
// arm mask reaches the frame's bottom row with the offset and stops 5 px short
// without it, and visible skin drops 43.4k px against 45.3k unnudged.
// The sniper and pistol seats stay exactly on the solve: the AWP's wrist is
// occluded by its chassis, and on the pistols the fist under the slide is the
// whole silhouette — nudging the SEAT off the grip reads instantly as a
// floating hand. The pistols' own cut-sleeve report ("you can see the arm
// being cut off inside the screen") was real but it was a wrapper framing
// fact, not a seat fact — fixed by reframing the pistol entries in PROC_POSES
// (see the note there), which move gun and arm together and leave this solve
// alone.

// CLOSING THE HAND.
//
// Three reports of "the hand is inside the gun" were all the same fact, and it
// is not a placement fact: THE AUTHORED HAND IS NOT A FIST. MEASURED off
// npc-arms-ct.glb — knuckle row to fingertip is 73.5 mm in a straight line
// (a human finger is ~75 mm), the fingers are barely curled, and a voxel search
// over the whole hand at 4 mm finds exactly ONE enclosed cell of air. There is
// no bore through it. So no root transform can make it hold a 31 mm pistol
// grip: swept over +/-60 mm of seat, the best any position achieved was 60-70%
// OF THE GRIP'S VOLUME INSIDE THE HAND. The grip went in one side of the fist
// and out the other, which from the eye reads exactly as the complaint — a hand
// with the receiver through it — and no amount of moving it fixed that, which
// is why two rounds of moving it did not.
//
// The hand has finger bones. `_poseNPCArms` now closes them.
//
//   curl  [MCP, PIP, DIP] radians, applied to each of Index/Middle/Pinky about
//         that bone's own local -X. MEASURED which axis that is: a -0.4 rad
//         nudge on Index1R walks the fingertip 18.6 mm toward -x and 22.0 mm
//         toward +z, i.e. straight at the palm, while +X, +/-Y and +/-Z all
//         swing it away from it.
//   thumb [flex, spread, tip] — the thumb lies along the back strap rather than
//         curling with the fingers.
//
// The 1.20 rad voxel-solved fist was measured tight and looked WRONG, and the
// player said so looking at the M4: folded to a full fist the hand reads as a
// pale ball parked at the receiver/stock junction — knuckles proud of the
// receiver line, thumb bump hooked over it, the wrist reading as a cut end —
// "a half cut hand [that] goes into the weapon and does not really hold it".
// The presentation rule that replaced it: the hand exists peripherally, the
// player reads the GUN, and any trade between grip correctness and hand
// visibility is decided toward LESS VISIBLE.
//
// So the LONG GUNS (rifle/smg/sniper) now curl just far enough to stay
// visually connected, and no further. MEASURED from the eye position
// (?arm=1&eye=1, FOV 74, 2560x1440, skin forced to a flat key and counted):
//   - dead straight (the original 74239b6 pose) the hand tears into separate
//     skin patches from the eye — 3 patches on the AWP (11.3k/1.8k/0.9k px),
//     3 on the AK, 2 on the MP5 — the "open palm you can see through".
//   - the gap closes at MCP 0.15 rad on both gap-prone guns and stays closed
//     from there up; [0.35, 0.20, 0.12] is 2.3x that threshold and still takes
//     the fingers 71% of the way back toward straight from 1.20.
//   - visible skin on the M4 falls from 54.7k px (1.20 fist, the screenshot
//     complaint) to 43.4k at 0.35 with the seat offset; every long gun is one
//     connected skin mass and nothing crosses the weapon's top silhouette.
// The thumb follows the same rule: [0.15, 0.05, 0.10] lies flat along the
// strap instead of folding over the top of the grip.
//
// The PISTOLS keep the full solved wrap, deliberately. Opening the pistol
// fist was shot both ways and less curl LOSES on both counts there: the open
// fingers swing around the visible side of the grip (deagle skin 96.1k px
// open vs 90.7k closed — the fist under the slide IS the pistol's whole
// contact patch, there is no receiver to hide behind), and with the light
// thumb the thumb tip shows in the tang notch behind the slide (3 columns,
// 32 px above the top silhouette; the 0.35-flex thumb pulls it back under —
// re-measured to 0 columns). A pistol fist wrapped tight is also simply what
// the pose is in reality; nothing about it read as wrong from the eye.
//
// The knife and the grenades keep an open hand: their handles are 20-30 mm
// across and their poses were never reported. A light curl only.
